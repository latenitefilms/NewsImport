If you have footage that contains a `.newsml.xml` and/or `.vpms.xml` sidecar file, this tools allows you to access this metadata from within a supplied Final Cut Pro Metadata View.

This is useful if you're working with news outlets that use the NewsML-G2 standard or a VPMS system, and you need to reference this metadata for deliverables.

News Import works well alongside other 3rd party applications such as [Producers Best Friend](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/producers-best-friend/id688519794?mt=12).

This is a simple niche app, that saves high-end professional assistant editors using Final Cut Pro hours of time.
